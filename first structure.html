            <p>Tor tika boro shuor r nai.<i>Bap mayer poisha</i> nosto korbi na asuda bar bar koitasi kintu.<b>JEE te faltu result korsos private college paya laisos</b> ,eibar r oi privilege nai.<br>Now English. Wait this is very awkward to be typing these things on your own PC, which is actually i3 and gets heated up very quickly.However that will not stop you from practicing the programming and other concepts which will be helpful.<br> You feel this is hard, you feel there is no way you can take this anywhere , however imagine having a project next to your name in the 1st year itself. a proper work. No matter big or small , put in the work and there is no way you will be at a net loss. the paragraph ends here,enough gibberish. </p>
